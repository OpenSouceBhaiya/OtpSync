OTP Sync is a privacy-first, open-source tool designed to securely beam incoming One-Time Passwords (OTPs) from your Android device directly to your PC's clipboard. It works instantly by scraping notifications natively on your device without polling APIs or requiring account logins.

Unlike traditional cloud-sync applications, OTP Sync operates on a strict **Local-First, Zero-Knowledge** architecture. Your OTPs and sensitive data are processed locally and are never stored on any server.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Lightning Fast Sync:** Beams OTPs from your phone to your PC clipboard the millisecond they arrive.
* **🔒 Military-Grade Encryption:** Utilizes AES-256-GCM End-to-End Encryption. Only your paired PC has the keys required to decrypt the payload.
* **🕵️ Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** Firebase is utilized strictly as a transient, real-time relay. Encrypted packets self-destruct within 5 seconds and are completely unreadable by our systems or any third-party.
* **🎨 Seamless UI/UX:** Enjoy Mac-style slide-in notifications on your PC whenever an OTP is securely copied, keeping you in the flow.
* **🔋 Battery Optimized:** Leverages the native Android Notification Listener to instantly detect OTPs without polling, saving your battery life.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Android 15 & RCS Business Messages
On newer Android versions (Android 15+), the operating system introduces a security feature that **actively redacts OTPs** appearing in notifications. The OS replaces the actual code with the text `"Sensitive notification content hidden"`. 

This redaction completely blocks third-party apps from extracting OTPs that arrive via **RCS Business Messaging** (e.g., from Google or Microsoft with the blue verified checkmark). Because RCS bypasses the standard SMS broadcast receiver, the `NotificationListenerService` is the only way to read them, and it is blinded by the OS.

**The Workaround:** 
To allow OTP Sync to extract these messages, you must force them to arrive as standard SMS:
1. Open the **Google Messages** app.
2. Go to **Messages settings** > **RCS chats**.
3. Toggle off **Turn on RCS chats**. 

When sent as standard SMS, the messages are intercepted securely at the hardware level via `SmsReceiver` *before* the notification system redacts them, allowing instant sync to your PC.
